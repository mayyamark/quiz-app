# Quiz App
As part of our volunteering work to improve the quality of education in the country, we, **Nadya & Mayya** are tasked to implement an application that can be used to effectively create and carry out online quizzes.

- **DB_USER**: the *username* of your MariaDB account;
- **DB_PASSWORD**: the *password* of your MariaDB account;
- **SECRET_KEY**: *secret data*, for a possible access, please contact us;
